**1.WIRE AND REG**

Wires are nets which model the interconnections between hardware components. They act as real wires in circuits.
Reg is register data type which holds a data until a new value is passed onto it. Unlike real hardware registers, reg data type does not need clock signal for its operation.
Declaration of wire and reg is done inside the module, but outside procedural blocks(like always and initial).

```
Syntax-
wire a; //variable a of wire type 
reg a; // variable a of register type
```
Default value -

wire---->z (high impedance)

reg----> x (unknown)



**2.INTEGER**

It declares an integer variable which can hold values between (-2^31 to 2^31-1).
```
Syntax-
int a;\\ variable a of integer type
```
Default Value---> x(unknown)

**3.REAL**

It is used to declare variables of real type. Real variables are stored as 64 bit quantities.

```
Syntax-
real a; \\ variable a of real type
```
Default Value---> 0

**4.TIME**
   
It is a 64 bit quantity . It is unsigned integer type used to store system time. It is associated with $time system function and it returns the simulation time.
